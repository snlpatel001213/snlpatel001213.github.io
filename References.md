                    <p>It is a pleasure to write recommendation for Sunil, I know him as a highly motivated and result-oriented professional. His biggest strength lies in leveraging big data ecosystem and distributed computing(Spark/Scala/GPU computing) for solving complex predictive analytical task with deep learning. He is well versed with deep learning architectures and frameworks, which he has demonstrated by building efficient NERs (target/disease identification), the task included text-mining/NLP of huge amount of research data archived in Pubmed and development of CvNN+LSTM classifier. 
                        He has developed and deployed very efficient NERs in very short span of time. He has significantly contributed towards Text-Mining, NLP and Competitive Intelligence offerings by Excelra. He is a great asset to any organization he works for, and I recommend him without reservation. </p>
