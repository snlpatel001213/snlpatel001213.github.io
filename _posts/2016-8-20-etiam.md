# Detectron 2 Mask R-CNN R50-FPN 3x to TensorRT

**If you dont want to do setup part as mentioned from step `1. Build Container`**

**Pull these ready-made container** 

**Container 1** -  only for .pt  to .onnx conversion (step1)

	docker pull supatel001213/detectron-trt-conversion:v3-part1

**Container 2** -  converting `model.onnx` to `converted.onnx` (step 2) and trt conversion (step 3)

	docker pull supatel001213/detectron-trt-conversion:v3-part2

# 2. Conversion

# 2.0 Add classes to the yaml file  | In Container 1
file location: `/workspace/detectron2/configs/Base-RCNN-FPN.yaml`
```yaml
  ROI_HEADS:
    NAME: "StandardROIHeads"
    IN_FEATURES: ["p2", "p3", "p4", "p5"]
    NUM_CLASSES: 46
```  

## 2.1 To onnx  | In Container 1

```bash
cd /workspace/detectron2/tools/deploy/

python export_model.py \
    --sample-image /maskRCNN/model_dummy_1344x1344/1344x1344_export_img.jpg \
    --config-file /workspace/detectron2/configs/COCO-InstanceSegmentation/mask_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x.yaml \
    --export-method caffe2_tracing \
    --format onnx \
    --output /maskRCNN/model_dummy_1344x1344 \
    MODEL.WEIGHTS /workspace/model_dummy_1344x1344/dummy_maskrcnn_model_dummy_wt_random.pth \
    MODEL.DEVICE cuda

```
Please change the path according to your directory structure.

## 2.2 Optimize ONNX to TRT friendly graph | In Container 2

```bash
cd /workspace/detectron2trt/

python create_onnx.py \
    --exported_onnx /rift/model_dummy_1344x1344/model.onnx \
    --onnx /rift/model_dummy_1344x1344/converted_new.onnx \
    --det2_config /workspace/detectron2/configs/COCO-InstanceSegmentation/mask_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x.yaml \
    --det2_weights /rift/model_dummy_1344x1344/dummy_maskrcnn_model_dummy_wt_random.pth \
    --sample_image /rift/model_dummy_1344x1344/1344x1344_export_img.jpg
```
Please change the model path, image path and output path.

## 2.3 Convert ONNX to TRT | In Container 2

```bash
cd /rift/model_dummy_1344x1344/
trtexec --onnx=converted_new.onnx --saveEngine=converted_new.trt --useCudaGraph
```
Please change the path according to your directory structure.


## 2.4 Eval

It will require coco eval annotation set  at `/workspace/oss/samples/python/detectron2/datasets/coco/annotations`
It will require  coco eval images at `/workspace/detectron2/datasets/coco/temp/val2017`

```bash
cd /workspace/oss/samples/python/detectron2/eval.sh
python eval_coco.py \
    --engine /workspace/model_1344x1344/engine.trt \
    --input /workspace/detectron2/datasets/coco/temp/val2017 \
    --det2_config /workspace/detectron2/configs/COCO-InstanceSegmentation/mask_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x.yaml \
    --det2_weights /workspace/detectron2/model/model_final_f10217.pkl
```
This will compare accuracy after conversion w.r.t coco eval set
