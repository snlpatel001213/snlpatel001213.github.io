                    <b>Python</b>
                    <p>Most of my routine work is with python. Python for all prototyping work. Apart from core python I know to build C/C++ bindings with pybind11 module. I have even written and uploaded my packages on pypi.
                        My daily work involve working with libraries such as Cupy, Numpy, Pytorch and other members of python data science ecosystem.

                    <b>C/C++</b>
                    <p>I use C/C++ when it comes to writting most optimized operations. For example writting Non max suppression operation for any module. I am familer with STLs. Most of my work with Gstreamer and Deepstream is in C/C++</p>

                    <b>C#</b>
                    <p>I have written entire AirControl simulator in C#. With unity I always use C# as thats the only option.
                        Writting everything in C# helped a lot in refressing my OPPS concepts.

                    <b>Nvidia CUDA</b>
                    <p>I am familer with CUDA, not an expert but intermedite. I know to work with grid,block and thread levels. I have written operations like 1) Parallel implementation of loop 2) Nonmax supression for detectors
                        3) Post processors for detection and segmentation network 4) Working with shared memory.

                    <b>CUPY</b>
                    <p> Its a library in python but a powerful weapon in itself. CUPY does the same in GPU what numpy does in CPU. CUPY runs operations many time faster than Numpy. 
                        Hence when it comes to writting GPU supported operations interfacing with python, CUPY is the goto option.
